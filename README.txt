This is a simple implementation of perlin noise.
I only tested the 2D noise generator, but 1D, 3D, and N dimensional versions
of the lib are also available. These are extrapolated to a certain extend from 
the 2D generator code, so it might not behave as it should. I'll try to implement
test programs for them later.
